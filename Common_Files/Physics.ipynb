    "\n",
    "**In developing CFD simulation for a fluid mechanic problem understanding the general physics and fundamental theory of the problem is extremely important. This knowledge would provide users the ability to make logical decision about the geometry of CFD domain, choice of proper boundary conditions and numerical models for the CFD simulation. Furthermore, user will have a general big picture on the expected outcome of simulation. These knowledges and abilities form the foundation for a successful implementation and validation of the CFD simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, understanding physics and theory of problem before developing a CFD simulation can be thought of turning on a flash light before taking any step in a completely dark room. Hence, let's review the fundamental physics and theory behind the problem of 2D laminar flow over a cylinder as the first step for development and validation of CFD simulation for this problem of interest:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental and interesting case studies in the field of fluid mechanics is the flow field evolution as the fluid interacts with a blunt object. Among different shapes for a blunt object, 2D cylinder (simple version of 3D sphere) is known to be one of the most applicable and popular geometries that many scientists investigate the flow field around it both numerically and experimentally. The behavior and physics of the flow field around a 2D cylinder is strongly dependent on the ratio of inertial to viscous forces (a.k.a Reynolds number) within the flow. As this force ratio increases the physics of the flow around and in the wake of the cylinder would change it's pattern and becomes unsteady with complex physics. Fig. 1 visualizes this flow field evolution via simple sketch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 1 shows, as the Reynolds number increases, the flow would change it's pattern that changes instantaneously with time, which is called the unsteady flow. Unlike the steady flow, which happens at low Reynolds numbers, the unsteady flows have more complicated physics and harder to theoretically model and investigate. Therefore to investigate and simulate an unsteady flow, some further implementation should be carried out in comparison to the steady cases.\n",

    "Fig 1. Sketch of the flow field evolution around a 2D cylinder according to the ratio of inertial to viscous forces (i.e. Reynolds number) within the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the physics of the unsteady flow field around and in the wake of a 2D cylinder, first the Control Volume (CV) analysis approach is used. By definition, a control volume is a limited inertial frame of reference within the continuum of a flow that encloses the blunt object and flow field around it, shown in Fig. 2. According to the control volume analysis the two major physical variables that will be conserved within this control volume are **mass** and **momentum**. Writing down and balancing these conservation equations for each of these variables would provide important information about the behavior of the flow around 2D cylinder.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conservation of mass ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of conservation of mass equation applied to the defined control volume, visualized in Fig. 2, has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{CV} \\rho~dV + \\int_{CS} \\mathbf{n}~.~\\rho \\mathbf{V}~dA = 0 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $\\mathbf{V}$ is the flow velocity on the control surfaces of the control volume boundaries, which has an area of $dA$ and a normal vector of $\\mathbf{n}$. In the case study of a unsteady flow, where the first term of the equation could not be omitted as in the steady cases, one should take good care of the velocity change from one moment to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first term on the left hand side of the above equation represents the temporal evolution of the mass ( $\\rho~dV$ ) within the defined control volume. In the steady state case this term would be equal to zero, since no flow field variables would change with respect to time. However, for the unsteady case this evaluation will be different. To evaluate this term for the unsteady case during a specific time interval, it is considered that at two instant of times *$t_0$* and *$t_0+\\partial t$*, where the *$\\partial t$* is a differential instant, the changes of mass within the flow are very small and therefore can be neglected. Hence, one can assume that throughout this time step of *$\\partial t$* the flow is in a steady state condition. With this assumption, one can estimate the flow evolution within each time step between *$t_0$* and *$t_0+\\partial t$* by evaluating the incoming and out-going mass flux terms from/in to the boundaries of the control volume. Once this estimation is done for the desired time step (*$t_0$* to *$t_0+\\partial t$*), the flow field state in the end of the time instant *$t_0+\\partial t$* is used as the initial state of the flow to evaluate the flow evolution within the next time step (*$t_0+\\partial t$ to $t_0+2*\\partial t$*). Integration of these evaluated flow field during each time step over a large number of time interval would provide a clear understanding of the flow pattern as it evolves within a specified time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering during each time step the most important component of the flow velocity is the streamwise component, the above equation can be simplified significantly. Furthermore, knowing the variation of incoming velocity into the control volume will give the variation of the outgoing velocity field, after interacting with the cylinder. Therefore, conservation of mass would provide the velocity field variation within the flow for each time step and the entire desired time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservation of momentum ###\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a general understanding about the interaction between the flow and cylinder the equation for conservation of momentum is used. Upon interaction between the flow and cylinder there are two force components acting on the body of cylinder. One force component is in the streamwise direction and is called the **Drag Force**. The other component is perpendicular to the streamwise flow direction and is called the **Lift Force** (i.e. flow tries to lift-up the cylinder). For a stationary cylinder due to the symmetry of the flow field on the top and bottom of the cylinder, the lift forces acting on these regions cancel each other out. Therefore, the net lift force on the cylinder will always be equal to zero. However, there will be a significant drag force on the cylinder wall as a result of it's interaction with the flow. To obtain an estimate for this drag force acting on the cylinder, one can consider the conservation of momentum in streamwise direction. The general form of conservation of momentum equation applied to the defined control volume showed in Fig.2 is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R_{ext}} + \\mathbf{F_v} -\n",
    "\\int \\mathbf{n}~p~dA +\n",
    "\\int \\rho \\mathbf{g}~dV = \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int \\rho \\mathbf{V} dV +\n",
    "\\int (\\mathbf{n}~.~\\rho \\mathbf{V}) \\mathbf{V} dA .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation assuming that the effect of viscous forces within the flow ($F_v$) are negligible within the control volume around the cylinder, neglecting body forces, terms one and four from right in the above equation will become zero respectively. Furthermore, since the surfaces of the inflow and outflow within the control volume are far from the cylinder one can conclude the pressure would be constant and in the opposite directions on the surfaces of control volume. Application of all these assumptions to the conservation of momentum equation will result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R_{ext}}= \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int \\rho \\mathbf{V} dV +\n",
    "\\int (\\mathbf{n}~.~\\rho \\mathbf{V}) \\mathbf{V} dA .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation reveals that unlike the steady states flow case study, the total external force on the cylinder (i.e. drag force here) is no longer only equal to the difference between the incoming and outgoing momentum of the flow form the control volume boundaries. There is an additional term, the temporal changes of the momentum within the control volume, that affects the value of total external force on the cylinder in an unsteady flow. Therefore, to evaluate the total external force on the cylinder within the unsteady flow using above equations, one will solve each terms of the equation within defined time steps as explained in the conservation of mass. Then integrate the obtained solutions within the desire time interval. In case where the total external force changes constantly with respect to time, an average of it will be the final value of the force.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion the equations of conservation of momentum, knowing the incoming flow conditions into the control volume, would provide the value of forces exerted on the cylinder by the flow. Furthermore, this equation reveals that the total external force ($\\mathbf{R_{ext}}$) on the cylinder is a function of fluid properties (i.e. density), area of interaction and the velocity evolution within the flow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensional Analysis ###\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the control volume analysis on this flow field, the conclusion is that the drag force on the cylinder is a function of fluid properties (i.e. density), area of interaction and the velocity evolution within the flow. Although this conclusion is important, it reflect a complex dependency including multiple variables. Performing dimensional analysis on the flow over a cylinder immersed in a flow of a constant velocity $V$ one can reduce this complex dependency in a simpler format. Starting the dimensional analysis and using the previous developed understandings it can be showed that the drag force acting on the cylinder is a function of following flow variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{F_D} = f~(d,\\mu,\\rho,V) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d$ is the dimension of the cylinder, $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ are the viscosity and density of the fluid. As there are 5 variables and 3 reference dimensions (i.e., Mass, Length, Time), two non-dimensional groups (i.e. $\\Pi$ groups) are needed to fully define the flow field around a cylinder defined. Performing dimensional analysis result in tothe two following non-dimensional groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi_1 = \\frac{\\rho V d}{\\mu}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi_2 = \\frac{\\mathbf{F_D}}{d^2 \\rho V^2 }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as shown previously using control volume analysis, it can be concluded the drag force on the cylinder is a function of velocity field through an unknown function $\\phi$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathbf{F_D}}{d^2 \\rho V^2 } =  \\phi( \\frac{\\rho V d}{\\mu}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The left hand side of this equation is the non-dimensional drag force and referred to as the drag force coefficient. The right hand side of this equation is the ratio of inertial forces to the viscous forces within the flow, which is known as Reynolds number. This outcome of the dimensional analysis confirms that the drag force on the cylinder in a uniform flow is a direct function of Reynolds number. Therefore, majority of scientists investigating on this flow field look at the variation of these two variables to find the function $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_D = \\phi(Re)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation $C_D$, the total coefficient of the drag force due to pressure and viscous forces within the flow acting on the cylinder's surface in the streamwise direction. This coefficient is the normalized drag force component with the available momentum in the undisturbed incoming flow that could be exerted on the cylinder. The value of this momentum is calculated using $\\rho$ as the reference density of the flow, which is the density of the flow. $V$ as the undisturbed streamwise flow velocity in the inlet and $d$ is the diameter of the cylinder surface. In some formulation  and books the term $d^2$ is replaced with $A$ as the projected area of the cylinder. For a two-dimensional cylinder the projected area is equal to the diameter of the cylinder. This is the area where pressure and viscous forces are acting on the cylinder in the streamwise direction. It should be reminded that the pressure and viscous forces in the perpendicular direction to streamwise direction cancel each other. Hence, the forces and areas that they act on does not have any contribution to the drag force and coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the above discussion the velocity field (i.e. Reynolds number) and drag force (i.e. Drag coefficient) are the two most important variables of interest in understanding the physics behind the case study of flow over a cylinder. As it was explained earlier theoretically modeling and evaluation of the flow field variables details requires significant amount of time and calculations. It will be even harder to model and evaluate the flow field evolution in the unsteady case. This is when numerical modeling and specifically the concept of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) comes into play. With the help of CFD and Finite Volume mathematical analysis, one can divide the fluid's domain of interest into multiple small *control volumes*, called meshes elements, and model the flow field variables numerically for steady and unsteady flows using the basis of theoretical approaches explained above.In the next sections it will be discussed how one can move forward to initiate developing the CFD domain and simulations for this problem of this flow field of interest interest."
