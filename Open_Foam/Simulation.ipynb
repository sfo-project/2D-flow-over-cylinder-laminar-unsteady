    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "** The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions. **\n",

    "\n",
    "**0. Import the CFD Domain into Solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The previously generated CFD domain, fully explained in the Domain section, will be imported properly into the CFD solver.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of **2D Unsteady Laminar Flow Over a Cylinder** are explained in great details. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in `OpenFoam/run/tutorials`. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of **2D Unsteady Laminar Flow Over a Cylinder** looking at the available standard solvers [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/standard-solvers/) in OpenFoam the appropriate application candidates would be either `icoFoam` or `pisoFoam`. Both of these standard solvers can be used to solve unsteady incompressible flow. However, due to the simplicity of the configuration files for the `icoFoam` solver, the tutorial of **cavity** located at `tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/airFoil2D` is used as the base simulation. Using the previously developed configuration files, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development is performed via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and are located in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0. Importing the Created CFD Domain into Solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The official mesh generator for OpenFoam is called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMesh</span>. This is a command base mesher software. Users write/edit the desired settings to generate and discretize the geometry of CFD domain in a dictionary file (i.e. a text file) named <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMeshDict</span> located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant\\\\polyMesh</span> inside the main working directory. In simple words the file is the dictionary, where the geometry and discretization process of it are fully defined. Once edits of `blockMeshDict` file are completed then it is compiled via the command <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMesh</span>. This will generate multiple required files, that include the details of the discretized CFD domain for the use of OpenFoam solver in the directory of the `blockMeshDict` file. Readers can read more about the `blockMesh` utility [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/blockmesh/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, OpenFoam has various built-in commands that allow it's users to convert their previously generated CFD domain in different mesher packages into the readable format for the OpenFoam. A list of these commands can be found [here](http://www.openfoam.org/features/mesh-conversion.php). In this tutorial this alternative approach is used to convert the previously generated CFD domain with * .msh format to the readable format in OpenFoam. In order to perform this process users put the * .msh file of the previously generated CFD domain in the main working directory and use the command <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluentMeshToFoam</span> with the name of the mesh file after the command to perform the mesh conversion process (i.e. <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluentMeshtoFoam [file name]. msh</span>). This will generate multiple required files, that include the details of the discretized CFD domain for the use of OpenFoam in the working directory. Users should make sure that the generated report contains no error or problem. The details of the previously generated CFD domain in * .msh format are fully explained in the Domain (see <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Common_Files -> Domain</span>) part of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption in the classical problem of a two dimensional unsteady laminar flow over a cylinder is that due to the flow separation from the top and bottom of cylinder and process of vortex shedding into the wake of cylinder the flow field properties would change rapidly with respect to time. Therefore, flow will be unsteady and a transient scheme is chosen to develop this CFD simulation. This along with other numerical schemes settings are set in a dictionary file called \"fvSchemes\" located at `\\system` folder. To set the solver to be unsteady users define `Euler` for the `ddtSchemes` which is a First order, bounded, implicit time scheme as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "ddtSchemes\n",
    "{\n",
    "    default         Euler;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the flow properties doesn't change with respect to time, such as cases where the Reynolds number, based on cylinder diameter (as the length scale), is less than the critical value of 100 the appropriate steady model should be chosen in this step by setting the `ddtSchemes` to `steadyState`. All available time schemes along with their implementable option within \"fvSchemes\" dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvschemes/). Furthermore, since the `icoFoam` application is recommended for laminar flows only by default it will consider that the flow field is laminar. Thus, no further setup is required here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainty in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the bases for expected physical observations. The material properties in OpenFoam can be defined in a dictionary file `transportPropertise` located in `constant` folder. In this file the material is set to be `Newtonian` fluid with a defined kinematic viscosity **\\nu**. It should be noted that the numbers in the [] set the dimension of the flow field variable of interest and the other number sets it's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "transportModel  Newtonian;\n",
    "\n",
    "nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 0.01;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Considering that the cylinder diameter in 1 [m] and user will define a unit constant uniform velocity (1 [m/s]), the value of **\\nu** will be defined as the inverse of Reynolds number. Therefore, changing this value would set the nominal Reynolds number of the flow based on the cylinder diameter. For other cases users should define the working fluid via this process. Various available transport models along with other options within `transportPropertise` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here] (http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/transport-rheology/#x40-2210007.3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**   \n",
    "In OpenFoam the type of boundaries within the CFD domain are defined in the `boundary` file located at `\\constant\\polyMesh`. Whether the users use blockMesh or the convert command to create the CFD domain and discretize the `boundary` file will be created in this process. Furthermore values for the field variables, such as velocity **U** and pressure **p**, at these boundaries are set in `U` and `p` files located at `0` folder located in the working directory respectively. The `0` folder includes the values of the field variables at boundaries for the time `t=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier in the CFD domain's creation and discretization section, the CFD domain has four faces as boundaries. The boundary and zone conditions settings to develop CFD simulation for **2D Unsteady Laminar Flow Over a Cylinder** case in OpenFoam are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inlet:** The flow enters from the inlet face of the CFD domain with constant velocity and uniform atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure).

    "**top & bottom:** The CFD domain is bounded via two surfaces on top and bottom named after their location within the domain as **top** and **bottom** respectively. These two surfaces have significant distance from the cylinder, which is located in the center of the domain. Therefore, any potential blockage effect or forced accelerated flow around the cylinder is removed. In order to make sure that these boundaries would replicate a semi-infinite domain in two directions a Symmetry boundary condition is set to these surfaces.

Based on the orientation of coordinates in the current CFD-domain the drag force direction is along x-axis (1 0 0), the lift force direction is along y-axis (0 1 0) and pitchAxis is along z-direction (0 0 1). The center of origin called `CodR` is located at (0 0 0). The other inputs for this function are reference values for velocity, density, diameter and area used to normalize the drag force to calculate the drag coefficient. Usually the values for these variables are defined as the free stream flow properties. In this case study reference values of velocity, density and diameter are all equal to 1. However, the value of reference area \"Aref\" should be defined differently! Fundamentally, the reference area to calculate the drag force coefficient is defined as the total \"effective\" area that the force of interest is acting against. In case of the flow over a cylinder the fluid forces on the body of cylinder can be visualized as shown in the Fig. 1:\n",

    "Each force component can be decomposed into two components in the horizontal and vertical directions shown with red and green colors respectively. Due to the symmetry of the geometry the vertical components of the forces cancel each other. Therefore, the total drag force is the summation of all horizontal forces that are acting against the projected area along the cylinder's wall as visualized in the zoom-in view of Fig. 1. This area is defined as the reference area `Aref` and is equal to diameter times the depth of the cylinder. For the current CFD domain the diameter is 1 [m] and the created depth of the mesh via \"blockMesh\" is 2.8 [m]. Therefore, the value of the reference area is 2.8 $[m^2]$. Note that for a purely 2D problem (with no depth in mesh) the value of depth is considered to be unity. Therefore, in that case the value of the reference area is 1 $[m^2]$\n",

    "At this stage the iterations for this simulation can be started by running the command `icoFoam` to call the chosen application to start running simulation. It is recommended to start simulations using `foamJob icoFoam` command. There are two reasons behind this recommendation: one is that this command will not print the residual values to the screen and therefore will be faster in long term. Second this command to store history of all residuals and in the end of simulation running the command `foamLog logs` will print them in data sets in a directory called `logs`. If users need to see the iteration progress and residual values the command `tail -f log` can be used."
